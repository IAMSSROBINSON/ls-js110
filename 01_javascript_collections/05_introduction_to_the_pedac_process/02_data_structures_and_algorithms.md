# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures influence the algorithm to come after. 
Decide what data structure is required to use - array / object?
Provide sufficient detail in the algorithm so that the coding with intent becomes easier to implement.

Try to work through the "understand the problem" part of this problem on your own, and write the input, output, and rules for it.

// PROBLEM: 
// Given a string, write a function `palindromeSubstrings` which returns 
// all the substrings from a given string which are palindromes. Consider // palindrome words case sensitive. 

// Test cases: 
// console.log(palindromeSubstrings("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")) 
// should return: ["ili"] // 
// console.log(palindromeSubstrings("abcddcbA")) 
// should return: ["bcddcb", "cddc", "dd"] // 
// console.log(palindromeSubstrings("palindrome")) // should log: [] // 
// console.log(palindromeSubstrings("")) // should log: []


P: Understand The Problem

CLARIFY
- What is a Palindrome?
  - a word that reads the sames forwards and backwards
- Since we are dealing with sub-strings of a string, how many characters would be considered a palindrome?
  - a palindrome substring is 2 or more characters in length
- What to do with empty strings?
  - return empty array
- Will all values be strings?
  - yes it does appear that way
- What to do with non-string values?
  - assume all values to be strings for now
- What if a string contains substrings separated by a space?
  - there are no examples of this consider only single word arguments
- What to do with non palindromes?  
  - return empty array


INPUT: string

OUTPUT: array of substring elements that are palindromes

RULES:
  EXPLICIT:
    - palindromes are strings read the same forwards and backwards
    - return only confirmed palindromes
    - strings that are palindromes are case sensitive (noon âˆš, nooN x)

  IMPLICIT:
    - a substring palindrome is 2 or more characters
    - empty strings return an empty array
    - no palindromes return an empty array

DATA STRUCTURE: return an array

## Algorithm

DETERMINING A SUBSTRING

- 2 or more characters

STRING: halo
ha
hal 
halo
alo
al
lo 

['ha', 'hal', 'halo', 'alo', 'al', lo]
