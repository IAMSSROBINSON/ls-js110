# `Array.prototype.includes()`

A built in JavaScript array method that performs a strict comparison on every element within the array and compares it to the value argument expression passed to the method. It returns `true` if a comparison evaluates to true otherwise it returns `false`.

- called on an array
- searches the array elements for comparison to the return value of the expression argument passed
- returns `true` if comparison is truthy
  - otherwise returns `false` if all evaluate to false.
  
- Does not specifically use the `===` operator as `array.includes(NaN)` will return `true` in this instance if `NaN` is present in the array. All other strict comparisons to `NaN` return `false` unless using `Number.isNaN(NaN) which evaluates to true`
- Remember two objects cannot be compared for strict equality unless they are the same object or reference to the same object and not comparing the object as a literal.

## Example:

```JavaScript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(array.includes(10/5)); // true, 10 / 5 = 2, 2 is included as an array value
```
