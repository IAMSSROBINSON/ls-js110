## E: Examples and Test Cases 

Examples can help in better understanding and clarification of the problem statement. 

Examples can be used to confirm or refute assumptions that we made (in the previous stage about) about the problem and help to answer questions regarding implicit requirements.

Test Case are examples but using specific examples using the chosen programming language. They are structured in such a way as to test a particular input against an expected output.

## Where Are Examples from?

Examples and Test cases may be provided within the problem statement or you may have to come up with them yourself.

### E: Examples
#### Sum Even Number Rows

Using examples we can confirm or refute any or all of the assumptions made in the previous section:

INPUT: 1(row number)
OUTPUT: 2 (sum of one int on row one: 2 + 0) √

INPUT: 2(row number)
OUTPUT: 10 (sum of two ints on row two: 4 + 6) √

INPUT: 3(row number)
OUTPUT: 20 (sum of three ints on row three: 8 + 10 + 12) √

INPUT: 4(row number)
OUTPUT: 68 (sum of four ints on row four: 14 + 16 + 18 + 20) √
