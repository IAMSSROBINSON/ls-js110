## C: Code With Intent

Implementing the solution with code.
The algorithm should be translated into coding with intent.

Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language used to implement it.

- features and constraints of the language 
- characteristics of data structures in the language
- built in functions and methods available
- the syntax and general patterns of the language

Additional implementation notes can be added where necessary.

The implementation stage is also where test cases should be produced if not already supplied.
