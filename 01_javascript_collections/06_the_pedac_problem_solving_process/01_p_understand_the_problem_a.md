## P: Understand The Problem

Throughout the entire problem solving process one should be constantly accessing our understanding of the problem, checking it, refining it and adjusting it where necessary.

It is important to understand the problem initially as it will set a frame of reference for which to begin solving the problem.

## Steps

- Establish the rules 
- Define the boundaries of the problem

by

- Examining and analyzing any information that is available about the problem, the extent of which will depend on the context in which the problem is encountered and how it is presented initially.

- After doing this, it can be a good idea to restate the problem in a language that is more descriptive to yourself

- Extract elements of the problem into a list of rules and requirements (Do not rush these steps):

  ### RULES AND REQUIREMENTS
  
 - RESTATE EXPLICIT REQUIREMENTS (Requirements that are stated in the problem statement)
  
 - IDENTIFY IMPLICIT REQUIREMENTS (Requirements that are inferred from the problem statement and or examples and test cases)
