# Array Element Reference

Arrays are also integer based zero indexed collections / lists. Specific elements can be referenced by stating the index position.

## `.array.slice()`

- returns a new shallow copy array // top level elements are duplicated, other nested arrays and objects still reference the original 
- `.slice()` does not mutate the caller
