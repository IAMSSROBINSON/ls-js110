# Generic Loops

Where a collection exists, it can be common to perform an action on each element in the collection. Instead of writing this action over and over again - a looping mechanism can be used to process some or all of the actions on the elements.

<br>

## Iterating Over Collections

### Strings

- use for and while loops to iterate over strings
- a counter variable is used to access each element value using string references
- stop the loop when the counter reaches the length of the string

<br>

### Arrays

- iterate over arrays using for and while loops
- a loop counter again is used to access each element
- counter stop when it reaches the length of the array

<br>

### Objects

- create an array of the objects keys using Object.keys(nameOfObject)
- iterate over the array and use the values to access the properties in the object
- stops when there are no more elements within the array to use
- forIn loop can be used to access the object properties in the object

<br>

## Loop Controls

### `break`

- allows for breaking out of a loop early

<br>

### `continue`

- allows for skipping current iteration of the loop each time it is encountered

<br>

### Guard Clause

- they are conditional statements placed within the start of a loop to handle specific cases separately.
