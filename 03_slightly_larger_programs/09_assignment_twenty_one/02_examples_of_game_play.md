# Examples of Gameplay

To give you an idea of how to play, try to decide what to do in each of these scenarios:

## Scenario 1

Copy Code
Dealer has: Ace and unknown card
You have: 2 and 8
You should hit in this scenario. You see the dealer has an Ace, which means the dealer has a high probability of having a 21, the optimal number. On top of that, your total of 10 can only benefit from an extra card, as there's no way you can bust.

## Scenario 2

Copy Code
Dealer has: 7 and unknown card
You have: 10 and 7
You should stay here since the chances are good that the unknown card is not an Ace, which is the only situation where you can lose. There's a small chance that you'll lose; most likely, you'll win with 17 or tie.

## Scenario 3

Copy Code
Dealer has: 5 and unknown card
You have: Jack and 6
This one is a little tricky, and at first glance, you may think that either hit or stay is appropriate. You have 16, and you could try to get lucky and land a card less than 6. That's okay reasoning, except for the fact that the dealer has a 5. You're anticipating that the unknown card is worth 10, thereby making the dealer's cards worth 15. That means that the dealer must hit, and there's a good chance it will bust. The best move here is to stay, and hope the dealer busts.

Hopefully, that gives you an idea of how fun and tricky this game can be, despite the simple rules!
