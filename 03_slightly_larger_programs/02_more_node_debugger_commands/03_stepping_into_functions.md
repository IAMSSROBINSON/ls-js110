# Stepping into Functions

It can be useful to step into a function that calls another function (e.g. a callback function) so that at the appropriate point in the programs execution the inner functions inner workings can be viewed.

The `s` / `step` command allows for stepping into function in this way. It is best used when the inner function invocation is reached and steps through it rather than moving over it to the next expression or function call. 

To step out of the function `o` / `out` is used once inside.
