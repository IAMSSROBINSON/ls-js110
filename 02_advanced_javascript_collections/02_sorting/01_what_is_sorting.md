# What is Sorting?

Sorting is setting the order of elements in a collection according to a set criteria.

It can be of benefit to sort a collection into a predictable sequence / order.
Sorting is typically done on an array since an elements index position is easy accessible and the order within the array is important.

- strings should be converted to an array before performing any sorting and then reconstructed back to a string if required since string alone cannot be sorted
- objects values are accessed via their keys so there is generally no need to sort
