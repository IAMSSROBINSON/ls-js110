# UTF-16

## Using operators like `< > ===` with strings

- string order is determined by a characters `code point` in the `UTF-16 encoding`. It is the `code point` that is compared when comparing one character to another using the relational operators.

- to get the UTF-16 character code point use `string.charCodeAt()` 
  - if used on a single character then no arguments are required
  - if used on more than one character you can pass an index argument to specify the designated character

```JavaScript
let plus = '+'
console.log(plus.charCodeAt()); // 43

let three = 3;
console.log(String(three).charCodeAt()); // 51

console.log('+' < '3'); // true, comparing two UTF-16 character code point values
console.log('+' < 3); // false, 43 is not less than 3, the 3 is not a string and it is not implicitly coerced to one
```

- uppercase letter comparisons will come before lowercase since the uppercase UTF-16 character code point will be less than the lowercase equivalent
- numerals from 0 - 9 and most (but not all) punctuation will come before letters
- accented and other characters come after the main ASCII table
- all other UTF-16 character code points will come after the main ASCII table and have a higher code point of at least 256
